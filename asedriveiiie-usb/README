Required: gcc 2.7 or higher, Linux kernel 2.4 or higher

***************************************************************

 What you need:
================

1) Get the latest version of PCSC Lite by David Corcoran.
You can get the latest version of PCSC Lite from:

http://www.linuxnet.com/middle.html

Follow the instructions and install it on your computer.


2) The ifd-AseIIIeUSB driver uses the libusb library to access USB devices. 
It can be downloaded from:

http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

You need to install this library and in particular its usb.h file which is 
needed in the driver's compilation under GNU/Linux.


 Installing the ASEDrive IIIe USB driver:
===========================================

To complie this package from a Linux prompt use the following:
 # ./configure
 # make
 # make install
                                                                                
The driver installs itself to /usr/local/pcsc/drivers by default.
To change this edit the Makefile.
                                                                                
This will create a shared library called ifd-AseIIIeUSB 
(under ifd-AseIIIeUSB.bundle/Contents/Linux) which is 
the library used to talk to the IFD Handler interface.  

You must be root to install all the files to their locations.


 Starting and testing:
=======================

To start the pcsc daemon you'll need root privileges.

 # /usr/local/pcsc/bin/pcscd

You should be able to communicate with the reader by now.

There is a small test program called "testpcsc" that comes with the 
pcsc-lite package. Refer to the pcsc-lite's README for compilation instructions.
This program tries to connect to the selected reader and to get the ATR.


 Notes:
========

- To see the driver's debug messages, add -DASE_DEBUG to CFLAGS 
in the Makefile. Recompile and rerun the installation script. Note that
the messages are written to the system log (usually: /var/log/messages).

- In order to use the USB ports your kernel needs to support usbdevfs.
You should have the following results:

$ grep usb /proc/devices 
180 usb
$ grep usb /proc/filesystems 
nodev   usbdevfs
nodev   usbfs

If it is not the case, you may have to recompile your kernel. More details
are available at: 

http://www.linux-usb.org/


- If the reader fails to function, check if your system supports usb. 
To do so, check if /proc/bus/usb/ exists, and if yes "cd" into this directory. 
Run the command "cat devices" and check if the reader appears. 

If your system does not support usb, you may need to reinstall/reconfigure it.
