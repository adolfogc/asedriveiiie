 What you need:
================

Get the latest version of PCSC Lite by David Corcoran.
You can get the latest version of PCSC Lite from:

http://www.linuxnet.com/middle.html

Follow the instructions and install it on your computer.


 Installing the ASEDrive IIIe Serial driver:
===========================================

To complie this package from a Linux prompt use the following:
 # ./configure
 # make
 # make install
                                                                                
The driver installs itself to /usr/local/pcsc/drivers by default.
To change this edit the Makefile and the etc/reader.conf file.
                                                                                
This will create a shared library called libAseSerial.so which is 
the library used to talk to the IFD Handler interface.  To install
this reader into the PCSC/Lite Architecture simply edit the etc/reader.conf
file included in the package and set the LIBRARY_PATH to the location
of the shared library.  An example reader.conf is provided in this package
in the etc directory.  Also, set the CHANNELID to the approprate serial
port desired.  Use the following values for CHANNELID:

COM1	0x0103F8
COM2	0x0102F8
COM3	0x0103E8
COM4	0x0102E8

For devices on the USB bus (e.g. a serial to usb adaptor) use:

/dev/ttyUSB0	0x800000
/dev/ttyUSB1	0x800001
/dev/ttyUSB2	0x800002
/dev/ttyUSB3	0x800003

DEVICENAME and FRIENDLYNAME should already be set and should not be modified.
When finished, simply copy the reader.conf file to /etc on your system.

NOTE: If a /etc/reader.conf file already exists on your system, simply append the 
contents of the edited file to the end of the exisiting one.


 Starting and testing:
=======================

To start the pcsc daemon you'll need root privileges.

 # /usr/local/pcsc/bin/pcscd

You should be able to communicate with the reader by now.

There is a small test program called "testpcsc" that comes with the 
pcsc-lite package. Refer to the pcsc-lite's README for compilation instructions.
This program tries to connect to the selected reader and to get the ATR.


 Notes:
========

- To see the driver's debug messages, add -DASE_DEBUG to CC 
in the Makefile and recompile.
Note that the messages are written to the system log (usually: /var/log/messages).
